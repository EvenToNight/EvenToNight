# Media Service

Minimal Node + TypeScript service scaffold for the `services/media` folder.

Quick start

1. Change to the media folder:

   cd services/media

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Run in development (auto-reload):

   npm run dev

4. Build and run production:

   npm run build
   npm start

Notes

- This scaffold uses Express. Install will fetch dependencies noted in `package.json`.
- If you prefer plain JavaScript, replace the contents of `src` and adjust `package.json` accordingly.
