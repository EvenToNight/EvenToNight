      summary: Handle Stripe webhook (Stripe signature validated)
      description: |
        Handles incoming Stripe webhook events. Validates the 'stripe-signature' header and the raw request body using Stripe's signing secret.
        
        - The endpoint expects the exact raw body as sent by Stripe (not parsed JSON).
        - The 'stripe-signature' header is **required** and is used to validate the event.
        - If validation fails, a 400 Bad Request is returned.
        - On success, processes the event and returns `{ received: true }` or `{ received: false }` if the event type is unhandled.
      parameters:
        - name: stripe-signature
